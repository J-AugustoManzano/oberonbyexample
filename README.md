## Oberon by Examples

[Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language)) is a general-purpose programming language created in 1986 by Niklaus Wirth and the latest member of the Wirthian family of ALGOL-like languages.

[Oberon-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon-2) is an extension of the original Oberon programming language developed in 1991 at ETH Zurich by Niklaus Wirth and Hanspeter Mössenböck that adds limited reflection and object-oriented programming facilities, open arrays as pointer base types, read-only field export.

Oberon By Example is a hands-on introduction to Oberon-2 using examples.
